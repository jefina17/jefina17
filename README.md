- 👀"Fun fact about me: I've found my true passion in programming, and my love affair is with Python. Just like a maestro conducts an orchestra, I orchestrate data with Pandas and NumPy, creating harmonious data symphonies. When it comes to visualization, I'm a visual storyteller, painting insights with Matplotlib and Seaborn. And SQL, well, it's my language of data, where I craft stories from rows and columns."


- 📚"I'm currently diving into the worlds of data visualization and data modeling, along with exploring the intriguing realm of ethical hacking.
- 🧩 Programming is like an endless puzzle, and I'm the eager solver. With data, I 🎨 paint stories; with code, I craft solutions. In the world of hacking, I'm the friendly spy 🕵️ seeking digital adventures. 💻🌐
